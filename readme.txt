Smart Diet Assessment Project

Obesity is one of critical factors for well-being since it can increase the risk of many diseases such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, etc. To help the dieters, many researchers and companies purposed the diet monitoring systems. However, these system could not solve the low adherence problem.  Smart diet assessment system such as MT-Diet (https://impact.asu.edu/MTDiet.html) are being recently proposed.  In the system, there are two main tracks: (1) image based food type identification and (2) gesture based nutrition intake information retrieval. In this course, we will concentrate on only the second track. 

Gesture based Nutrition intake information retrieval
We consider estimating the food amount that the user consumed in real time in units of calorie intake per second. As the solution of this problem, we propose a project, gesture based nutrition intake information retrieval by analyzing the user eating gesture with wearable armband or wristband sensors. 

There are five phases in this project
