Dataset explanation (EMG, IMU)

IMU file consists of 11 columns: UNIX time stamp, Orientation X, Orientation Y, Orientation Z,Orientation W, Accelerometer X, Accelerometer Y, Accelerometer Z, Gyroscope X, Gyroscope Y, andGyroscope Z.

EMG file consists of 9 columns: UNIX time stamp, EMG 1, EMG 2, EMG 3, EMG 4, EMG 5,EMG 6, EMG 7, and EMG 8.


Synchronization between Myo and Video

The data collection application does not guarantee what the start time between Myo data and Videoframe are the same. The end time between Myo and Video, however, is the approximately same.Therefore, we can synchronize two dataset by setting the last frame time to the last UNIX time stamp inIMU or EMG file.
